## General info
A discord bot I made on someones request. It has the ability to subscribe to sites and notify when something new comes up on them. The targetted website of this bot was mangadex.org, and the bot has the ability to subscribe to mangas on that site and give notifications when a new chapter comes out. However, the bot is easily scalable due to my well-written code and can be expanded to any site I wish.
