## General info
A website I made for learning purposes. I followed a course to finish this project. The main focus of this website is to let users add activities and attend the existing ones. The project may seem simple at first but it turned out to be rather complicated and I learned a lot from it.

## Features
* User authentication with JWT
* The backend is written in Mediator pattern
* Users can chat in-real time thanks to SignalR
